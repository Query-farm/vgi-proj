# vgi-proj — dev and test targets.
#
# Usage:
#   make test       # unit/integration (pytest) + end-to-end SQL (haybarn-unittest)
#   make test-unit  # pytest only
#   make test-sql   # DuckDB sqllogictest .test files via haybarn-unittest
#
# test-sql is self-contained: it points VGI_PROJ_WORKER at the worker run as a
# stdio subprocess (exactly how DuckDB drives it after ATTACH) and runs the
# files under test/sql/. haybarn-unittest is a uv tool:
#   uv tool install --prerelease allow 'haybarn-unittest>=2.0.0rc11,<2.1'   # ~/.local/bin/haybarn-unittest
# haybarn 2.0 is required: its community `vgi` extension is the one that speaks the
# worker's VGI protocol (vgi.v3 / 3.2). --keep-home lets the runner see the
# extensions installed under the real $HOME (haybarn-unittest 2.0 isolates it).

# Worker command DuckDB uses for ATTACH (overridable). Use the project venv's
# interpreter with absolute paths: haybarn cd's into a staging dir before ATTACH,
# and the venv already has the current SDK installed (unlike `uv run`, whose
# PEP 723 script env can resolve a stale cached SDK).
